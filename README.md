# is31fl3741-spin
-----------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller, ~~P2X8C4M64P/Propeller 2~~ driver object for the IS31FL3741 LED matrix driver.

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or ~~[p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P)~~. Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* I2C connection at up to 400kHz

## Requirements

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library
* 1 extra core/cog for the PASM I2C engine

P2/SPIN2:
* p2-spin-standard-library

## Compiler Compatibility

* P1/SPIN1 OpenSpin (bytecode): OK, tested with 1.00.81
* P1/SPIN1 FlexSpin (bytecode): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* P1/SPIN1 FlexSpin (native): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta
* ~~P2/SPIN2 FlexSpin (nu-code): FTBFS, tested with 5.9.7-beta~~
* ~~P2/SPIN2 FlexSpin (native): OK, tested with 5.9.7-beta~~ _(not yet implemented)_
* ~~BST~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~Propeller Tool~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~PNut~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)

## Limitations

* Very early in development - may malfunction, or outright fail to build
* Not optimized
* API not yet finalized
* The only layout tested is with the Adafruit PN 5201 panel. Other modules that use the IS3741 may have a different LED matrix layout vs the chip's memory, so the display may look incorrect on them.
